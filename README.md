The essence of Mass and Gravity: Mass as Compressed Space-State, Gravity as Stretched Space-State

## How SU(3) Generators Mediate Mass Formation：
They compress local space while performing 3D modulation, axis transformations, and compression-phase adjustments to ensure the compressed space remains approximately spherically symmetric. As a result, the gravitational field generated by mass (the stretching of external space due to local compression) is also spherically divergent, guaranteeing the isotropy of mass-induced gravity. The physical picture is now clear.

## The essence of mass is the storage of gravitational (spatial elastic) potential energy under the interaction of SU(3) corresponding to the compression of space.

Dimensional analysis dictates that the relationship between mass and energy must satisfy [E]/[m][v²], with the proportionality coefficient determined by the fundamental constants of spacetime (the speed of light, c).

The compressed potential energy of mass in localized space is inherently mainly released as gravitational waves with radiation, which propagate at speed c , thus directly yielding  △E=△mC².

The dual mechanism—where the QCD color interaction-SU(3) acts as a compressive spring system, while the Higgs mechanism functions like a preloaded torsional spring combined with a ratchet (enabling unidirectional energy storage while preventing reversal)- provides a vivid mechanical analogy for how fundamental particles maintain their mass stability in the quantum spacetime fabric. Just as a ratchet's teeth enforce unidirectional motion through asymmetric geometry, the Higgs' chiral coupling to the SEQ ground state spin with fixed chirality may similarly lock the gluon field's compressive energy in an metastable configuration.
